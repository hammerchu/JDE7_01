Hong Kong Style Iced Lemon Tea Recipe香港凍檸茶
(Prep time: 2 mins  Cook time: 15 mins)

Ingredients 
Glass Pitcher (1 liter capacity)

7- 10 bags Lipton Yellow Label Tea
4 1/4 cups boiling water
2 lemons
4 tbsp sugar (or more to taste)
Ice

Directions:

Boil water and pour into your glass jug.  Immerse tea bags in the water for 10-15 minutes.  Add sugar and stir a bit while the water is still hot so as to melt the sugar.

Once you think the tea is strong enough for your taste, remove the tea bags.  (In Hong Kong, this tea is made quite strong.)  Allow the tea to cool.  

Slice four slices of lemon.  Add ice to your glass (long and tall is preferred), then place lemon slices over.  Fill up glass with your sugared tea and serve!

Tip:  In Hong Kong Cha Chaan Teng ( or Hong Kong style diners)  this Iced Lemon Tea is served along with a spoon and a straw.  The spoon is for pressing down on the lemon slices to release lemon juice into the iced tea.  How much you press is your preference.  

Personally I usually don't press very much, finding that the presence of the lemon slices already creates enough of a lemony fragrance.
