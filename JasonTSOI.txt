Ingredients
Neutral oil (such as vegetable or canola oil)
2 medium onions (very thinly sliced)
1 pound very thinly sliced beef (fatty beef chuck or ribeye)
2 teaspoons sugar
2 tablespoons mirin
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 cup dashi stock (can also substitute beef or chicken stock)
4 eggs
4 cups cooked white rice (short grain or medium grain preferred)
1 scallion (chopped)
2 teaspoons toasted sesame seeds (optional)

Instructions

Heat the neutral oil in a large skillet over medium high heat, and cook the sliced onions for about 10 minutes, stirring often.
Add the beef and sugar, and cook until the beef is slightly browned. Add the mirin, soy sauce, and stock. Bring to a simmer, and cook for about 10-15 minutes to reduce the stock into a thin sauce. Taste for seasoning, and add a little more soy sauce if needed.
Meanwhile, heat another couple tablespoons of oil in a cast iron or non-stick skillet. Cook the eggs sunny-side up. You can cook them in batches if needed. The yolks should still be runny!
When the beef is done simmering, divide the rice among serving bowls (the original recipe is for 4, so 4 bowls), and top with the beef and an egg for each bowl. Garnish with chopped scallion and toasted sesame seeds, if using.
