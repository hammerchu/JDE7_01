Sure, here's a lighter version of Chicken Cacciatore, an Italian dish that's flavorful and satisfying while being relatively healthier:

Ingredients:

- 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 onion, diced
- 2 bell peppers (red, yellow, or green), sliced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1 teaspoon dried rosemary
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 1/2 cup dry white wine (or chicken broth)
- 1 can (14 oz) diced tomatoes
- 1/2 cup low-sodium chicken broth
- 1/2 cup sliced mushrooms
- 1/4 cup pitted olives (black or green), halved
- Fresh parsley, chopped, for garnish

Instructions:

1. Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper on both sides.
2. In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the chicken breasts and cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side, or until they are golden brown and cooked through. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.
3. In the same skillet, add the diced onion and sliced bell peppers. Sauté for about 3-4 minutes until they start to soften.
4. Add the minced garlic, dried oregano, thyme, rosemary, and paprika. Sauté for an additional 1-2 minutes until fragrant.
5. Pour in the white wine (or chicken broth) to deglaze the skillet, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom.
6. Stir in the diced tomatoes, chicken broth, sliced mushrooms, and olives. Bring the mixture to a simmer.
7. Return the cooked chicken breasts to the skillet, nestling them into the sauce.
8. Cover the skillet and let the chicken simmer in the sauce for about 10-15 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.
9. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper if needed.
10. Sprinkle chopped fresh parsley over the top before serving.
11. Serve the chicken cacciatore over whole grain pasta, rice, or with crusty whole wheat bread.

This lighter version of Chicken Cacciatore is packed with flavor from the herbs, vegetables, and olives. By using less oil and opting for lean chicken breasts, it's a healthier alternative to the traditional recipe. Enjoy your delicious and nutritious meal!
