Directions
Preheat a gas grill with all burners on High for 10 to 15 minutes. Shape pizza dough into a circle.

Reduce the flame on half of the grill burners to Low, to create areas of direct and indirect heat.

Carefully place dough onto the grill over direct heat. Close the cover. Let dough grill until the bottom is just barely cooked and shows char marks, 1 to 3 minutes.

Use tongs to flip pizza dough over; move to the indirect heat. Brush dough with pesto. Sprinkle with cheese. Scatter on zucchini, summer squash, bell pepper, red onion, and bacon.

Grill until cheese is melted, about 3 minutes. Carefully remove pizza from the grill.

Optional: Brush crust edges with butter glaze and place pizza under the oven broiler, until golden.
