Ingredients
2 6-inch square pieces of kombu
6 dried shiitake mushrooms
12 cups water (2.8 L)
1 cup bonito flakes (Katsuobushi)
12 ounces soft tofu (340g)
5 tablespoons white miso paste
2 cups baby spinach
2 scallions (chopped)
Instructions
Rinse the kombu and dried shiitake mushrooms under cold running water, and then add to a medium stockpot. Add 12 cups water, and allow to soak for 1 hour.
After soaking, place the pot over medium heat, and allow the stock to come up to just a simmer. Fish out the kombu, increase the heat to high, and bring to a boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and add the bonito flakes. Simmer for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Strain the resulting dashi stock into a medium saucepan to make your soup (reserving the shiitake mushrooms), and place it over medium low heat. Cut the tofu into Â½-inch cubes and set aside. Whisk the miso into the stock until fully incorporated.
Add the tofu, spinach, and scallions. Slice a couple of your shiitake and add those to the pot as well. Simmer for another couple minutes and serve.
